When records in a resource need to be used as select options, the **refine** `useSelect` hook allows you to handle an Ant Design [Select](https://ant.design/components/select/) component. Also this hook includes out-of-the-box features such as fetchSize, sorting, and filtering. You may examine the code below to learn how to create and manage Select component with `useSelect`.
