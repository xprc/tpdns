It is a hook that returns `breadcrumbs` to create breadcrumbs for the current page. The `breadcrumbs` are an array of objects with the following properties:

-   `label`: the label of the resource.
-   `href`: the route of the resource.
-   `icon`: the icon of the resource.

:::tip
You can refer to the [source-code][source-code] of the `useBreadcrumb` hook to see how it is built.
:::

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useBreadcrumb } from "@pankod/refine-core";

export const Breadcrumb: React.FC = () => {
    const { breadcrumbs } = useBreadcrumb();

    return (
        <ul>
            {breadcrumbs.map(({ label, href, icon }) => (
                <li key={label}>
                    {icon}
                    {href ? <a href={href}>{label}</a> : label}
                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    );
};
```

The `breadcrumbs` are created with your resource definitions. For example, if you have a resource with the following definition:

```tsx
[
    {
        name: "posts",
        icon: <div>icon</div>,
        list: () => <div>List Page</div>,
        create: () => <div>Create Page</div>,
    },
];
```

-   On the `list` page of the `posts` resource, the breadcrumbs look like this:

    ```tsx
    [
        {
            label: "Posts",
            href: "/posts",
            icon: <div>icon</div>,
        },
    ];
    ```

-   On the `create` page of the `posts` resource, the breadcrumbs look like this:

    ```tsx
    [
        {
            label: "Posts",
            href: "/posts",
            icon: <div>icon</div>,
        },
        { label: "Create" },
    ];
    ```

:::info
If resource has no `icon` property, the `icon` property of the breadcrumbs is `undefined`. Likewise, if the resource's list page is not found, the `href` property of the breadcrumbs is `undefined`.
:::

If you have a nested resource definition as below:

```tsx
[
    {
        name: "cms",
    },
    {
        name: "users",
        parentName: "cms",
        list: () => <div>List Page</div>,
        create: () => <div>Create Page</div>,
    },
];
```

-   On the `list` page of the `users` resource, the breadcrumbs look like this:

    ```tsx
    [
        { label: "Cms" },
        {
            label: "Users",
            href: "/users",
        },
    ];
    ```

-   On the `create` page of the `users` resource, the breadcrumbs look like this:

    ```tsx
    [
        { label: "Cms" },
        {
            label: "Users",
            href: "/users",
        },
        { label: "Create" },
    ];
    ```

### i18n support

If resource definition has `label` property, `useBreadcrumbs` uses the `label` property. Otherwise, the `name` property of the resource is used. Likewise, if resource definition has `route` property, `useBreadcrumbs` uses the `route` property. Otherwise, the `name` property of the resource is used.

:::info
If label is not provided in your `posts` resource `useBreadcrumb` uses the [`useTranslate`](/api-reference/core/hooks/translate/useTranslate.md) hook to translate the names.

For CRUD operations (`list`,`create`,`edit`,`show`) the `useBreadcrumb` uses the `actions` key to translate key `` translate(`actions.${action}`) ``.

For example; `create` action should look like : `` translate(`actions.create`) ``
