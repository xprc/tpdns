##     Best UI Frameworks for React.js


In this post, I have listed some of the best React frameworks that are most popular and that I believe will be popular in 2022.

<!--truncate-->

### What is React?

React is a JavaScript library that was developed by Facebook. It is one of the most popular libraries for building user interfaces.
React has a number of features that make it an attractive option for developers to use when building their next front-end project. React is very easy to learn and can be used in any type of project. It also has a large community, which means you will always find help when you need it.

React has a number of frameworks that are competing to be the best framework in 2022. It is not easy to create a React project from scratch, but with the help of some libraries and frameworks, it can be done in no time.

Table of Contents

1. [Create React App](#cra)
2. [Material-UI](#mui)
3. [Ant Design](#antd)
4. [React Bootstrap](#react-bootstrap)
5. [Refine](#refine)


### 1. Create React App <a name="cra"></a>

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

You don't need to learn and configure many build tools. Instant reloads help you focus on development. When it's time to deploy, your bundles are optimized automatically.

**Get started in seconds**
Whether you‚Äôre using React or another library, Create React App lets you focus on code, not build tools.

To create a project called my-app, run this command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
**Example**

### 2. Material UI <a name="mui"></a>

First up, [Material UI](https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/) is an excellent React UI framework with multiple pre-built components and templates. Material UI is a great framework for building UI components. It has a large community of developers and is very popular.

MUI provides a robust, customizable, and accessible library of foundational and advanced components, enabling you to build your design system and develop React applications faster.

```
// with npm
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

// with yarn
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
**Example**

### 3. Ant Design <a name="antd"></a>

Looking for a React admin panel framework that is both attractive and easy to use? Look no further than React [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce). This library provides everything you need to get started quickly, including components, layout templates, and powerful routing capabilities. Best of all, it conforms to the popular Ant Design style guide, so your app will look great whether it's running on a desktop or mobile device.

```
// with npm
npm install antd

// with yarn
yarn add antd
```

**Example**

### 4. React Bootstrap <a name="react-bootstrap"></a>

This [UI Kit](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction) library provides a React alternative to Bootstrap, giving you more control over the function of each component. With this framework, it's easy for developers who want an online presence without having too much work with coding or design skills! You can find thousands of themes made using these components as well so there will be something in here perfect just what your needs are at any given time.

```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3

```
**Example**

### 5. refine <a name="refine"></a>

If you're looking for a framework that will let your data- intensive application run at top speeds with extreme customizability, then look no further than refine. This React based headless system has been designed specifically for speed - allowing users to bring their own UI and update it via [refine's](https://refine.dev/docs/getting-started/overview/) powerful interface!

**Key features**

‚Äã
üî• **Headless** : Works with any UI framework

‚öôÔ∏è **Zero-configuration** : One-line setup with [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate). It takes less than a minute to start a project.

üì¶ **Out-of-the-box** : Routing, networking, authentication, state management, i18n and UI.

üîå **Backend Agnostic** : Connects to any custom backend. Built-in support for [REST API](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/simple-rest), [GraphQL](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/graphql), [NestJs CRUD](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/nestjsx-crud), [Airtable](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/airtable), [Strapi](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi), [Strapi v4](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi-v4), [Strapi GraphQL](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi-graphql), [Supabase](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/supabase), [Hasura](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/hasura), [Nhost](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/nhost), [Appwrite](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/appwrite), [Medusa](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/medusa), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Directus](https://directus.io/) and [Altogic](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/altogic).

üìù **Native Typescript Core** : You can always opt out for plain JavaScript.

üêú **Enterprise UI** : Works seamlessly with Ant Design System. (Support for multiple UI frameworks is on the Roadmap)

üìù **Boilerplate-free Code** : Keeps your codebase clean and readable.

There are two ways to add UI elements to refine;

1. Using a UI Library such as Tailwind, Chakra UI, etc.
2. Using a complete UI Framework such as Ant Design, Material UI, etc.

The recommended way is using the [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate) tool. superplate's CLI wizard will let you create and customize your application in seconds. You can find tutorial from [here](https://refine.dev/docs/core/tutorial/)

```
npx superplate-cli -p refine-react tutorial
```
