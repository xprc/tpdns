## About

[**refine**](https://refine.dev/) offers lots of out-of-the box functionality for rapid development, without compromising extreme customizability. Use-cases include, but are not limited to _admin panels_, _B2B applications_ and _dashboards_.

## Documentation

For more detailed information and usage, refer to the [refine documentation](https://refine.dev/docs/).

## What is refine?

**refine** is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based framework for building internal tools, rapidly. :sparkles: It ships with [Ant Design System](https://ant.design/), an enterprise-level UI toolkit.

Refine offers lots of out-of-the box functionality for rapid development, without compromising extreme customizability. Use-cases include, but are not limited to _admin panels_, _B2B applications_ and _dashboards_.

## What is a "headless" Framework?

**refine** is a **headless** React framework, which means all out-of-the-box features(**Routing**, **Networking**, **Authentication**, **Authorization**, **State Management**, **Realtime**, **i18n**, etc.), it can be used without being tied to any UI elements or framework. Also, Ant Design as out-of-the-box is supported.

-   Customization & Extensibility - UI is a completely customizable area and each developer uses different solutions. **refine** features does not restrict or interfere with your UI structure. **refine** allows the you to design and customizable the UI based on their unique use case.

-   Separation of Concerns - **refine** as a framework, is not responsible for your UI and is independent.

-   Maintenance - By removing the API surface to support every UI use case, **refine** easy to use and update/maintain is simple.

###

## Key features

üî• **Headless** : Works with any UI framework

‚öôÔ∏è **Zero-configuration**: One-line setup with [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate). It takes less than a minute to start a project.

üì¶ **Out-of-the-box** : Routing, networking, authentication, state management, i18n and UI.

üîå **Backend Agnostic** : Connects to any custom backend. Built-in support for [REST API](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/simple-rest), [GraphQL](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/graphql), [NestJs CRUD](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/nestjsx-crud), [Airtable](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/airtable), [Strapi](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi), [Strapi v4](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi-v4), [Strapi GraphQL](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/strapi-graphql), [Supabase](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/supabase), [Hasura](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/hasura), [Appwrite](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/appwrite), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Directus](https://directus.io/) and [Altogic](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/master/packages/altogic).

üìù **Native Typescript Core** : You can always opt out for plain JavaScript.

üêú **Enterprise UI** : Works seamlessly with Ant Design System. (Support for multiple UI frameworks is on the Roadmap)

üìù **Boilerplate-free Code** : Keeps your codebase clean and readable.

## Motivation

Higher-level frontend frameworks can save you a lot time, but they typically offer you a trade-off between speed and flexibility.

After many years of experience in developing B2B frontend applications and working with popular frameworks, we came up with a new approach to tackle this dilemma. This is how **refine** is born.

**refine** is a collection of helper `hooks`, `components` and `providers`. They are all decoupled from your UI components and business logic, so they never keep you from customizing your UI or coding your own flow.

As **refine** is totally _unopinionated_ about UI and logic, it's strongly _opinionated_ about three parts of your application:

1. **API Networking**
2. **State Management**
3. **Authentication & Authorization**

We believe, these are the most important components of a data-intensive frontend application and should be handled in a robust way by leveraging industry best practices.

**refine** guarantees you a perfect implementation of these building blocks in your project, so you can focus on your development.

## Architecture

**refine** makes extensive use of [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper) as a default way for interacting with your components.
Under the hood, **refine** relies heavily to [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for data handling, caching and state management.
Access to external sources and API's happen via providers which are basically plug-in type components for extendibility.

## Benchmark

After releasing the first internal versions, we had the chance to migrate some of our _React_ projects to **refine**.
In addition to **shorter development** times and **overall performance gains**, we've measured significant reduction in project size.

**refine** makes your codebase significantly smaller, by eliminating redundant code such as _reducers_, _actions_ and _unit tests_. Below is a size comparison for an example project:

## Quick Start

Run the **create refine-app** CLI tool with the following command:

```
npm create refine-app tutorial
```

Follow the _CLI wizard_ to select options and start creating your project.

After setup is complete, navigate to the project folder and start your project with:

```
npm run dev
```

Your **refine** application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Replace the contents of `App.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { Refine, useOne } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import {
    Layout,
    ErrorComponent,
    LightTheme,
    ThemeProvider,
    notificationProvider,
    RefineSnackbarProvider,
    CssBaseline,
    GlobalStyles,
} from "@pankod/refine-mui";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <ThemeProvider theme={LightTheme}>
            <CssBaseline />
            <GlobalStyles styles={{ html: { WebkitFontSmoothing: "auto" } }} />
            <RefineSnackbarProvider>
                <Refine
                    routerProvider={routerProvider}
                    dataProvider={dataProvider(
                        "https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev",
                    )}
                    notificationProvider={notificationProvider}
                    Layout={Layout}
                    catchAll={<ErrorComponent />}
                    resources={[{ name: "posts", list: PostList }]}
                />
            </RefineSnackbarProvider>
        </ThemeProvider>
    );
};

export const PostList: React.FC = () => {
    const getOne = React.useCallback(useOne, []);
    const columns = React.useMemo<GridColumns<IPost>>(

            {
                field: "actions",
                headerName: "Actions",
                renderCell: function render({ row }) {
                    return <EditButton hideText recordItemId={row.id} />;
                },
                align: "center",
                headerAlign: "center",
                minWidth: 80,
            },
        ],
        [getOne],
    );

    const { dataGridProps } = useDataGrid<IPost>({
        columns,
    });

    return (
        <List>
            <DataGrid {...dataGridProps} autoHeight />
        </List>
    );
};

export default App;
```

```tsx title="interfaces.d.ts"
interface IPost {
    title: string;
    createdAt: string;
    category: { id: number };
}

interface ICategory {
    id: number;
