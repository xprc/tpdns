## About Refine

[**refine**](https://refine.dev/) offers lots of out-of-the box functionality for rapid development, without compromising extreme customizability. Use-cases include, but are not limited to *admin panels*, *B2B applications* and *dashboards*.

## About This Tool

```sh
npx @pankod/refine-codemod --help
```

## General usage

In terminal, get inside your project root folder with `cd` and initialize `refine-codemod`:
